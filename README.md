# arduino-nano-light-strip

## forked from jollified/arduino-nano-light-strip

A simple light setup using the FastLED library for the WS2812B light strip where lights swipe across the strip, fade away, then swipe again, in a different color.

Feel free to use this, and tweak to your liking.

Reminder: count the number of leds on your strip, and set the NUM_LEDS variable as such, change DATA_PIN to the data pin you are using, and change your color order and chipset based on which strip you have.
5V is recommended, but 3.3V can work too.
